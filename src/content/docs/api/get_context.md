`get_context()` is for getting the data passing through the middleware chain. It takes the context struct as parameter.

```c
void *get_context(Req *req);
```

Example usage:

```c
example_context_t *example_ctx = (example_context_t *)get_context(req);
```

See the [Passing Data Chapter](/docs/middleware/#passing-data) for more information.
