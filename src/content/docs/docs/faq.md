## Is *Ecewo* Production Ready?

Ecewo is a **hobby project** that I'm developing to improve my programming skills and have fun. So it might not be production-ready yet, and it doesn't have to be.

## What Am I Trying To Do?

The point of Ecewo is to show that C can be useful for web development, just like the other languages, or even better than some of them. I'm trying to make it look like Express.js, so it should be easy to use. And I'm also trying to keep the memory management under the framework's responsibility as much as possible. I believe that C can also be very good for web for someone who prefers to use it.

## Why?

For the same reason as with other languages. You might prefer Rust for low-level web development, even though Rust doesn’t need to be used for many CRUD applications. JavaScript is enough for many of them. But JS is JS, Rust is Rust, and C is C. I want C to be a part of modern web development just like other languages for those who prefer to use C.

## Do We Need C Level Performance for Backends?

We don't. I just want to do something exciting.

## Where Does The Name *Ecewo* Come From?

I inspired by the name of my love.
